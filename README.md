# WellFired.Direct
An source code dump for our *deprecated* version of uSequencer unity's, first Timeline Editor!

We've removed all source assets and samples from the project in order to reduce the repository size. It's now basically only code.

If you're interested in upgrading from the Unity Asset Store version of uSequencer to WellFired.Direct, please follow the instructions at https://github.com/WellFiredDevelopment/WellFired.Direct.Upgrade

You can either clone this repo and build the code locally using Visual Studio, or Rider (We recommend Rider). or you can download the package from our release page, whatever suits you best.

Please note that since this tool is deprecated, it's unlikely we'll modify the source at all. That said, feel free to create pull requests and i'll do my best to integrate them.
